# Cryptography---Vignere_Polybius---Encoder_Decoder

In this project, Vigenere Cipher is implemented as the data encryption process. Then, the output is used as the input for the Polybius Cipher process. Two files are used for the user, namely encryptor.py and decryptor.py as programs. The purpose of this project is to implement Vigenere and Polybius Cipher encryption techniques in cryptography to enhance data security.
